# Comparison-of-Classical-Machine-Learning-Methods
The objective of this project is to implement and compare some of the standard approaches in machine learning. It is assumed that the reader is well aquanited with the theroy behind these methods. All methods were trained and tested on a subset of the MNIST digit dataset containing 5000 training images and 500 tests images of 28x28 sized grayscale images. All algorithms were implemented without the use of any libraries in MatLab except the Support Vector Machine, where the LIBSVM library was used. The project is a summary of the material covered in ECE175A at University of California, San Diego. The dataset can be downloaded via http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/courses/ece175/.
